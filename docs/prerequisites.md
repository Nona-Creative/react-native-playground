iOS Prerequisites & Setup
---

### Setup

[Install XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

### Install extensions

##### Install Pods

```bash
cd ios
gem install bundler # This may require sudo depending on your Ruby setup
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

### Physical device setup
   
1. In the ``/ios`` directory, run ``fastlane certificates`` to install certificates
2. To run the api on a physical device:
   1. setup a [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/user/signup) account and get your ngrok auth token.
   2. Paste your auth token in ngrok.yml(please note you will might need to run ``npm run init`` again).
   3. Then run ``npm run start:ngrok:local`` which will start the bundler with the ngrok api url

### Adding a physical device

> NOTE: to be able to run the app in development mode on iOS you need a valid certificate.

1. Get the UDID for your phone. [Use iTunes](https://www.imore.com/how-find-your-iphones-serial-number-udid-or-other-information)
2. Add your device to the ``devices`` variable in (``ios/fastlane/Fastfile``)
3. Run ``fastlane register_new_devices`` in the `/ios` directory

#### Use legacy build

App requires xcode to use legacy build. In order to set this up:
File < Workspace settings  < Build settings: Set as Legacy build system.
