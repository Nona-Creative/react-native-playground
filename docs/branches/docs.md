React Native Playground :: Branches :: docs
===

All documentation that belongs in ``develop`` should first 
be added to this branch and then merged into ``develop``.

Any additional documentation should exist in child branches of this branch.
eg.
```
docs__something-that-does-not-belong-in-develop
```
